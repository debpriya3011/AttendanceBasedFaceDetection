Overview
This project is a Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System that leverages data science and machine learning to automate attendance tracking. The application captures and analyzes facial data to offer a seamless, contactless, and accurate attendance solution. The core technologies used in this application include the dlib library for facial recognition, PyQt5 for the user interface, SQL Server for database management, and Twilio for SMS notifications.

Features
Face Registration: Register users' faces by capturing facial features through a webcam. Extracts unique face descriptors and stores them in the database with the user's ID, name, and phone number.
Face Deletion: Allows administrators to remove registered faces from the database.
Automated Attendance Logging: Continuously monitors video feeds, detects and recognizes faces, logs attendance, and sends confirmation messages via SMS.
Analytics and Reporting: Provides insightful attendance data through visual tools like bar graphs.
Export to Excel: Facilitates exporting attendance data to Excel for further analysis and record-keeping.
Technologies Used
dlib: High-accuracy facial detection and recognition.
PyQt5: Clean and intuitive user interface.
SQL Server: Efficient database management.
Twilio API: Sends real-time attendance confirmation messages.
OpenCV: Captures and processes video frames from a webcam.
Geocoder: Retrieves the geographical location of the user.


Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-detection-app.git
cd attendance-detection-app
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Twilio:
Replace the placeholder values in the send_attendance_confirmation function with your Twilio credentials.

python
Copy code
account_sid = 'ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
auth_token = 'your_auth_token_here'
from_number = '+12345678901'
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Usage
Register Faces:

Launch the application.
Use the face registration feature to add users by capturing their facial features.
Monitor Attendance:

The application will automatically detect and recognize faces from the video feed.
Attendance logs are updated in real-time, and SMS notifications are sent to registered users.
View Analytics and Export Data:

Access the analytics section to view attendance trends and patterns.
Export the attendance data to Excel for detailed analysis.
Example False Twilio Configuration
For demonstration purposes, you can use the following false Twilio configuration:

python
Copy code
account_sid = 'ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
auth_token = 'your_auth_token_here'
from_number = '+12345678901'
